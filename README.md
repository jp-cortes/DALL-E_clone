# Full Stack MERN AI Image Generation App MidJourney & DALL E Clone
This is a Full Stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) project that aims to create an AI image generation app similar to MidJourney and DALL-E. The app uses OpenAI API to generate images based on the user's text input.

# Project Overview
The app allows users to input a text prompt and generates an image based on the input. The image is generated using OpenAI's advanced AI algorithms. The project is split into two parts: the frontend and the backend.

The frontend is built using React and allows users to interact with the app by inputting a text prompt and viewing the generated image. The backend is built using Node.js and Express and is responsible for processing the user's input and generating the corresponding image.

The app also features a MongoDB database to store user input and generated images.

# Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

* /client: Contains the React frontend
* /server: Contains the Node.js and Express backend

# Project Dependencies
The project relies on several dependencies to function. Some of the major dependencies include:

* React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
* Express: Web application framework for Node.js.
* MongoDB: NoSQL document database.
* Cloudinary: To upload, store, manage, manipulate, and deliver images.
* Fetch: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
* dotenv: Zero-dependency module for loading environment variables.
* openai: Official JavaScript client for OpenAI's API.

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository
2. Install dependencies by running npm install in the /client and /server directories
3. Start the frontend by running npm start in the /client directory
4. Start the backend by running npm start in the /server directory
5. Once the frontend and backend are running, you can interact with the app by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.
